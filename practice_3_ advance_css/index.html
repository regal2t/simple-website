        <h1>10 skills you need to become a full-stack developer</h1>
        <p>Let's take a moment to recap those skills, and to discuss a few additional skills you'll want to build out
            over time. Here are 10 skills you need to become a full-stack web developer:</p>

        <h2> 1. Overall web architecture and application design knowledge</h2>
        <p>Understanding best practice web design will be critical as you intake business requirements and plan your
            approach.</p>

        <h2>2. HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML will be the core front-end programming language as you build out the overall structure of your webpages.
            CSS will help you customize the design of your HTML pages, rounding out the foundation of your front-end web
            developer languages.</p>

        <h2> 3. Ruby</h2>
        <p>Ruby is one of the most popular scripting languages in web development. Ruby is a dynamic open-source
            language that is fairly simple and productive, making it an excellent beginner language. </p>

        <h2> 4. PHP & Python</h2>
        <p>PHP and Python will serve as strong general-purpose languages to begin structuring your back-end solution.
        </p>

        <h2>5. JavaScript</h2>
        <p>JavaScript will bring your web applications the latest interactivity and rich user experiences expected of
            modern web design.</p>

        <h2>6. Node.js</h2>
        <p>The Node.js runtime environment will give you fast, scalable implementation for your application.</p>

        <h2> 7. Database programming skills</h2>
        <p>Whether it's SQL, such as through an Oracle database, or a NoSQL setup in MongoDB or Redis, you’ll need to
            understand how your web applications give, receive, and manage data throughout their life cycles.</p>

        <h2> 8. Git</h2>
        <p>Git is the standard for managing code, implementing version control, producing necessary documentation, etc.
            It serves as a key element of programmer's work and will be present throughout much of your code work for
            the web and non-web applications. </p>

        <h2>9. Understanding ongoing development and maintenance</h2>
        <p>As a full-stack programmer, you will be ideally situated to ensure that your applications receive the
            best-quality development and maintenance updates over their lifecycle. This will require you to stay abreast
            of new developments in the web technology sphere, as well as work with business stakeholders on their
            ongoing needs.</p>

        <h2> 10.Communication skills</h2>
        <p>Full-stack developers work with teams and individuals across the business. From user-facing teams and product
            managers, to other developers, to the SOC team, you'll be expected to effectively intake requirements or
            concerns, and communicate answers in a quick and professional manner.</p>
